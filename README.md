# FirstOpenGL
This is my first attempt at making really anything in openGL and C++, I am trying to learn off of documentation and as little tutorials as possible, so it will 100% be bad. I'm planning on using this as almost a diary of my experience. All of my descriptions will be placed here.

## >Initial Commit
I have done a small bit of work setting everything up that I needed, this contains all the files that I am currently using. I don't know where this project is going to go, but my plan is just to render a simple triangle first, then maybe a square, then a cube.

## >Window Added
I added a window, but whenever I would try and run the code to open the window it would close immediately, So I have to deal with that too. Then I was able to add window rescale functionality. With that done, I went though and commented to make sure that I truly understood what was going on. I am like 80% sure that the comments are correct.
